# Isbot2000

Wholesome(ish) reddit bot made by [u/Isbo2000](https://www.reddit.com/user/isbo2000/)

Somewhat configurable

# Specifications ig

Works on linux and somewhat on windows (not tested on mac or anything)

On windows the bucket chat bot feature does not work, but hopefully I can get that working in the newr future

# How to run

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Isbo2000/Isbot2000.git
cd Isbot2000
```
Change what is in the config file to your needs

Run the bot:
```sh
python main.py
```

Enter you bot authentication things (id, secret, bot username, bot password)

After that it should be good to go

keep in mind tho, i dont expect anyone to use this really, and its not the best

I will try to work on making it more customizable for others in the near future
