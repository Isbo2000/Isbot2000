Scientists say the odds of you being born are at least 1 in 400 trillion. Maybe even 1 in 400 quadrillions. 


That is incredibly unlikely to the point of impossible. So your birth was a unique event in the history of the cosmos. You were first, so you are with us.


A miracle is an event so unlikely as to be almost impossible. By that definition, I've just proven that you are a miracle.


Now go forth and feel and act like the miracle that you are, and if you ever feel that you are worthless, remember, if you were so, you would have lost to the race to be born. And yeah it's not an easy feat. :)
