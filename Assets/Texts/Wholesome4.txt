I just wanted to say that I know life can be hard, and that I know having poor mental health can be a real mf to live with, but don't give up!


Life is too precious to throw in the towel.


Just know that you aren't alone and if it all gets to be too much, then reach out and get help!


Even though it may not seem like it, I promise there are people that would rather see you overcome whatever's going on in your life like the champion that you are than attend your funeral <3"
