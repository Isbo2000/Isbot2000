Hey, are you ok? To be honest, are you actually ok? You could be lying to yourself.


If you don't feel ok, talk to someone, someone you trust.


They won't judge you and will help you if you're going through a tough time.


And you don't have to go into detail â€” if you just say that you're not feeling like yourself, that's enough.


Just get the conversation going, and if you feel like there's more you want to talk about, then find someone you trust to sit down with you and get more in-depth.


Remember, you're worth your time. This is a really important realization to make in your life.


You're worth talking to.
